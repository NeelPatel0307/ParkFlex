**ParkFlex**

Our project aims to develop a comprehensive online marketplace for parking spots, addressing the common urban challenge of finding convenient and affordable parking. It seeks to bridge the gap between parking spot owners who have underutilized space and drivers facing difficulties in locating parking, especially in densely populated areas. By leveraging technology, the platform aspires to optimize parking space usage, reduce urban congestion, and offer a convenient solution for both spot owners and seekers.
